I like maths, programming and problem-solving. Fortunately, Project-Euler combines all three!

  <strong>Too Long, Didn't Read!</strong>
  <p>
    I discovered Project Euler in 2020 and enjoyed solving problems during my computer science studies.
    After a break, I revisited it in 2023 with a focus on writing detailed, and
    incremental solutions to improve my communication skills.

> [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems

I discovered this website in 2020 during my second year of studying computer science. I really enjoyed my algorithms
course and often finished my TD (practical work) early, even before the session dedicated to it. Finishing the
TD while following the lecture was quite fun!. So, I would either help others or spend time (over) optimizing my code.
At some point, my teacher told me about this website, and I spent some time looking at the problems.

I solved the first 40 problems in the following months, then stopped. I don't really remember why, but it was probably
because of the beginning of a new project (Hello, my dear OCR).

In 2023, I decided to revisit Project Euler, but in a more structured way. I wanted to work on my explanatory skills, so
I decided to approach each problem incrementally, starting with the simple, inefficient solution -- usually
brute-force -- and then try to improve it.

More importantly, for every problem and every solution, I write an extensive and hopefully understandable explanation.
This helps me remember the solution, and it is a good exercise to train my writing skills.

I haven't updated this page for a while because writing solutions takes a lot of time, and I find it hard to dedicate
long periods to this. With time, I'll be able to complete the milestone of the first 100 problems and continue working
on the more difficult -- and more interesting -- problems.

If you're interested in my work, you can find the documentation presenting every solution I coded in python at this
address: [Project Euler](https://turtlesmoke.github.io/Project-Euler/) with the source code available on
my [GitHub](https://github.com/TurtleSmoke/Project-Euler).
