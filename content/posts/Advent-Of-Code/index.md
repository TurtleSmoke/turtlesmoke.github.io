Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. I enjoy the process of solving the problems with
the shortest code possible.

  <strong>Too Long, Didn't Read!</strong>
  <p>
    Every December, I look forward the start of the Advent of Code challenge.
    It's a month-long coding playground where I can dive into problem-solving without worrying about rulesâ€”just pure fun!
    I enjoy finding the tiniest code possible and embrace the rule-free coding month.
    If you're interested in checking out my code, you can find the full repository on
